# Use the Branches pane

Click **Branches** in the header to open a pane beside the graph with four sections:

- **Local Branches**: click one to limit the graph to it, and **Show All** to see every branch again. The checked-out branch is bold. **Checkout** appears on hover, and **+** creates a branch at HEAD.
- **Remotes**: each remote lists its branches, with **Fetch** on the remote and **Checkout** on a branch. The eye on a remote hides that remote from the graph, and the eye on the **Remotes** heading hides all of them; hidden rows stay listed but dimmed, and selecting one shows its remote again.
- **Tags**: click a tag to open the graph at that commit.
- **Stashes**: click a stash to see its diff, or use **Apply** and **Pop**. **+** saves a new stash.

Every row has the same right-click menu as its label in the graph, including **Focus this branch**, and the filter box at the top narrows all four sections at once. Long lists show 200 rows at a time with **Show more**.

The **Workspace** button opens a second pane that lists every repository and submodule with its branch, changed files and ahead/behind counts.
