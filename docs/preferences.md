# View preferences

Graph preferences belong to a repository path in the current VS Code workspace. Each repository
keeps its own choices; another workspace or clone starts with defaults. Changing these preferences
does not check out a branch or change Git refs.

Reloading an existing webview retains its search filters and vertical position as well as durable
preferences. Horizontal panning resets on reload; refreshing loaded history or resizing the graph
preserves it within the available scroll range. Selecting a commit can reveal its lane.

New repositories start in **Filter to branch**, with remotes visible and subtle dimming. In that
mode, the branch chosen on opening or switching follows **Show Current Branch by Default**; the
last filtered branch is temporary. Focus modes remember their target instead. **Clear focus**
stays cleared when returning to the repository, even though the selected focus mode is retained.

If a saved focus target was deleted or renamed, focus falls back to the current branch and keeps
the selected mode, dimming, and pause state. With detached HEAD or no current branch, it falls back
to **Show All** and clears pause. The fallback is saved, so recreating the old branch does not
silently restore the old target. Renames are not inferred from matching commit hashes.

Hiding the focused remote clears its target. Selecting a hidden remote branch reveals its remote
and enables **Show Remote Branches**; those updated choices are saved. Turning all remotes off and
back on preserves each remote's individual eye setting.

Deleting a repository's folder removes its saved preferences the next time the Workspace pane loads.
Existing focus choices in an open panel migrate to workspace storage the next time that repository
loads; previously saved column widths and remote visibility are retained.
