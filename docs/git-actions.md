# Working from the graph

All controls act on the repository selected in the graph, including initialized submodules. Clicking a repository's graph button in Source Control switches the graph to that repository. An action already running keeps its original repository; closing its dialog does not cancel Git.

## Getting started

After installing, VS Code offers the **Get started with (neo) Git Graph** walkthrough on the Welcome page, and the command **(neo) Git Graph: Open Getting Started Walkthrough** reopens it. Its five steps open the graph, explain how to read it, show where a commit's actions live, open the Branches pane, and cover recovery.

Inside the graph, a hint above the commit list says how to reach a commit's actions until the first menu opens. Every commit row shows a **⋯** button at its end on hover, and the settings cog holds **Getting Started** and **Learn more**, which opens this guide.

## Branches pane

**Branches** toggles a pane beside the graph with four sections: local branches, remotes, tags and stashes. Each section collapses independently, and the filter box narrows all of them at once. Clicking a local or remote branch selects its history using the header's **View** choice, and **Show All** restores every branch without dimming. Clicking a tag opens the graph at that commit. Clicking a stash opens its diff.

The **View** selector offers three ways to read a selected branch:

- **Filter to branch** keeps the existing view showing only that branch's reachable history.
- **Focus direct history** keeps every visible branch in place. The selected branch's first-parent history stays in full colour, merged-in history uses muted colour, and commits outside its ancestry turn gray.
- **Focus all ancestors** also keeps the surrounding branches, but gives merged-in history full colour.

Focus changes the view without checking out a branch. When enabled from **Show All**, it starts with the checked-out branch when available. Switching focus between branches keeps the rows and lanes in place. **Clear focus** restores full colour, and the view choice is remembered per repository. Hovering, keyboard focus, selection and the checked-out commit retain clear text and markers. Search still filters the visible commits; in focus views it searches across branches and colours matches using their actual ancestry, even when connecting commits are outside the page.

Right-click a local or remote branch label in the graph, or a branch in the Branches pane, and choose **Focus this branch**. It enables direct-history focus or keeps your existing ancestor mode, and resumes focus if paused. A **Focus** badge marks the target in both places, separately from the bold checked-out branch.

Use **Pause focus** to temporarily restore every branch's colours, then **Resume focus** to return to the same target and mode. The badge reads **Paused** while paused. **Dimming → Subtle / Strong** adjusts the graph lines and commit dots; text stays readable at either strength. The target, dimming strength and pause state are remembered per repository. **Clear focus** removes the target and its badges.

Every row carries the same context menu as the matching label in the graph, reached by right-click or its trailing menu button. The most common action is also inline: **Checkout** on a branch, **Fetch** on a remote, **Show in Graph** on a tag, and **Apply** or **Pop** on a stash. The **+** buttons create a branch at HEAD, add a remote, or save a stash.

Each remote has an eye button that hides its graph labels and commits reachable only through that remote. Shared history, local branches and tags remain visible. Hidden remote branches stay listed but dimmed; selecting or focusing one shows that remote again. Individual choices are saved per repository and also apply to history searches. Explicit commit or revision lookups can still open hidden history.

Hidden choices are restored when you reopen the graph. Renaming a remote through the extension keeps its visibility choice; removing it clears that choice. On refresh, choices for groups that no longer exist are removed, while groups with remaining remote-tracking refs keep their choice. A remote renamed outside the extension appears as a new, visible group.

The eye button on the **Remotes** section hides all remote branches temporarily. Showing them again preserves the individual hidden choices. Hiding a remote whose branch is selected clears that selection to **Show All** without checking out another branch. The settings cog in the header holds the global toggle and a shortcut to the extension's settings.

## Wide graphs

Branch lines stay within the **Graph** column, including after column resizing. When the lanes do not fit, use the horizontal scrollbar under the Graph heading, a horizontal trackpad gesture, or **Shift+mouse wheel** over the graph. The scrollbar also accepts keyboard arrow keys when focused. Only the lanes move sideways; commit text stays in place, and commit selection and expanded details remain aligned. Drag the boundary beside **Graph** to give the lanes more room.

The column headings and graph scrollbar stay below the main controls as you scroll down the history, including when the controls wrap in a narrow window. Normal mouse-wheel scrolling still moves vertically.

Clicking or keyboard-navigating to a commit brings its lane into view with the smallest necessary horizontal movement. To find it again after panning, use the crosshair button beside **Description**, labelled **Reveal selected lane**. Refreshing or resizing keeps your manual position where the graph still fits; switching repositories resets it. Revealing a lane leaves the branch, checkout, focus mode, and commit text position unchanged.

## Loading errors

If Git cannot load the graph, the view shows the error and a **Retry** button. Repair the reported problem, such as an unavailable repository, Git executable, or invalid Git configuration, then retry. **No commits yet** is reserved for a successful load of a repository without commits.

## Remotes and tracking

Open **Settings & Tools → Remotes** to add a remote, edit its fetch and push URLs, rename or remove it, or choose the repository's default push remote. Multiple URLs are entered one per line. Leaving push URLs blank restores Git's fallback to fetch URLs. Removing a remote removes its local remote-tracking references, not the server or local branches.

Right-click a local branch and choose **Configure Upstream** to set, change or clear tracking without pushing. The status strip shows the checked-out branch's upstream and ahead/behind counts. Counts reflect the last fetch. Branch labels also show nonzero counts, and their tooltips identify worktree locations.

**Fetch** can update one or all remotes, optionally pruning stale remote-tracking branches. Remote checkout offers **Fetch the latest remote revision before checkout**, enabled by default. It creates an explicit tracking branch, or checks out and fast-forwards an existing local branch. Divergent history is not reset.

**Push Branch** works for any local branch, including one that is not checked out. Choose the remote and destination branch, and optionally set upstream tracking. **Pull Branch** is available on the checked-out branch and uses fast-forward only.

Tag pushes use a remote chooser. Remote branch and tag menus also offer deletion, with confirmation naming the destination remote. Deleting a remote ref leaves the local branch or tag intact.

For deliberately rewritten commits, select **Force with lease** in the push dialog. The confirmation captures the last fetched remote commit. The push fails if the server has moved from that exact commit, even if another client fetches in the meantime. Fetch and inspect the remote branch before retrying a rejected lease.

## Conflicts and interrupted operations

The status strip identifies merges, rebases, cherry-picks and reverts in progress, including operations started outside the extension. It lists conflicted files and offers **Open Conflict** and **Stage Resolution**. Open Conflict uses VS Code's merge editor, falling back to opening the file.

After resolving and staging conflicts, use **Continue**. **Abort** restores the operation's starting state. **Skip Commit** is available for rebase, cherry-pick and revert. Git's own checks still apply. Changes to the operation between displaying and submitting a confirmation require a fresh status.

## Stashes

Open **Settings & Tools → Stashes** to save changes, optionally including untracked files. Each stash can be inspected as a diff in VS Code, applied, popped or dropped. Apply and pop can restore staged changes as staged. A conflicting pop keeps the stash and displays the conflicts. Drop requires confirmation. Stash selections include the commit ID so a newer stash does not silently redirect a pending action.

## Rebasing

Right-click a branch and choose **Move the current branch onto this (rebase)**. Commit or stash changes first. This uses Git's merge-preserving rebase and offers the same recovery controls if it stops.

For interactive editing, right-click an ancestor commit and choose **Edit commits after this (interactive rebase)**. The plan contains the current branch's commits after that ancestor, from oldest to newest. Move commits earlier or later, choose Pick/Reword/Squash/Fixup/Drop, and edit messages for Reword. Squash combines with the preceding retained commit and keeps the combined messages; Fixup discards the fixup's message. At least one commit must remain, and the first retained commit cannot be Squash or Fixup.

Stage changes in Source Control, then choose **Fold staged changes into this commit (fixup)** on the commit being corrected. Review the staged file list before submitting. **Arrange Fixup / Squash Commits** in the rebase editor places matching `fixup!` and `squash!` commits after their targets while preserving manual edits. Review the resulting order and actions before starting; ambiguous or unmatched targets remain Pick.

Interactive plans support linear ranges. A range containing merge commits is rejected instead of silently flattening its history. The plan is also rejected if the branch changes before submission. Plans and editor helpers live in that worktree's Git directory while a rebase is in progress and are removed after completion or abort; continuation works after reloading VS Code.

## Worktrees

Open **Settings & Tools → Worktrees** to inspect locations and checked-out branches, create a worktree, open one in a new VS Code window, or remove one. Creation accepts an absolute folder path and either a new branch with a start point or an existing branch. A branch already checked out elsewhere cannot be reused.

Removal preserves the branch. The main/current worktree cannot be removed from this control, and Git refuses removal of dirty or locked worktrees. No forced deletion is performed.

## Workspace and submodules

**Workspace** toggles a repository sidebar. It lists the same repositories as the picker: those found in the workspace folders within `maxDepthOfRepoSearch`, with their initialized submodules, plus any repository opened this session from Source Control or File History. A workspace folder inside a repository, or a symlink to one, lists that repository once under its real path, and the list follows added or removed folders and repositories. Each row shows the checked-out branch (or detached HEAD), changed file count, and ahead/behind counts from the last fetch. Click an initialized repository to switch its graph. Filter by name/path or show only repositories with changes; parent rows remain visible for context.

Submodule rows distinguish the actual HEAD, the revision recorded in the parent index, and the revision recorded in the parent commit. Their action menu offers **Initialize Submodule**, **Sync Submodule URLs**, and **Update to Recorded Revision**. Sync copies URLs from `.gitmodules`. Initialize/update use recursive Git checkout of the parent's recorded index revision, including nested submodules. Git checks for conflicting local changes; the extension rejects updates while an initialized child has an interrupted operation. No force checkout or `--remote` advancement is used.

Click either revision-change badge, or choose **Compare Submodule Revisions**, to inspect added and removed child commits. Toggle **Compare staged pointer** to compare the parent commit with its index; the other mode compares the index with the child checkout. **Stage Submodule Pointer** and **Unstage Submodule Pointer** change only that gitlink in the parent index, preserving other staged files, child files, and `.gitmodules`. Unstaging a newly added pointer removes it from the index. The dialog links to both graphs. Staged-only pointer changes count in the changed-repositories filter.

**Workspace Fetch & Update**, in the sidebar or Settings & Tools, fetches selected or all initialized repositories. Two workers run independently; a failed repository does not stop the others. Results remain available after hiding the dialog or switching graphs. Each successful fetch offers an upstream review for its current branch. Apply updates individually after inspecting the incoming commits; detached HEADs, missing upstreams, divergent branches, dirty worktrees, and active operations cannot be fast-forwarded through this control. Workspace results last for the current graph view.

## Synchronization review and branch cleanup

**Push Branch** opens **Preview Push** before sending commits. Review incoming/outgoing commits and the exact local and last-fetched remote tips. **Fetch & Refresh Preview** updates that information. New remote branches show the reachable outgoing history. Force-with-lease uses the reviewed remote tip as the expected server value; ordinary pushes retain Git's non-fast-forward protection. The pushed source is the reviewed commit ID, even if another client subsequently moves the local branch.

**Pull Branch** first fetches the selected remote, then displays the incoming and outgoing commits. **Apply Reviewed Fast-forward** requires a clean checkout of the selected branch and applies the exact reviewed commit without fetching again. A local or remote-tracking tip that changes before submission invalidates the plan. Refresh the preview to include later commits.

**Settings & Tools → Clean Up Merged Branches** lists local branches whose tips are ancestors of the current HEAD. Select branches and confirm the names and tips before deleting them. Branches used by any worktree, `main`, `master`, and known remote default branches are excluded. The backend repeats these checks and compare-and-deletes each selected ref using its reviewed tip. A failure stops the remaining deletions and reports how many completed. Remote branches are unaffected.

## Finding regressions with bisect

Open **Settings & Tools → Find a Regression (Bisect)**, or use **Use as Good/Bad Bisect Commit** on graph commits. Choose known good and bad endpoints, commit or stash changes, then **Start Bisect**. Git checks out candidate commits. Build or test each candidate, reopen the bisect controls from the status strip, and choose **Mark Good**, **Mark Bad**, or **Skip Untestable Commit**.

The result displays the first bad commit, or explains when skipped commits prevent a unique result. **Reset Bisect** ends the session and restores Git's original checkout. Native Git bisect state survives reloading VS Code, and stale classifications are rejected if the session or checkout changed. Changes made while testing must be committed or stashed before advancing/resetting. Other history-changing workflows that require an idle repository also require resetting bisect first.

## Search, file history, and comparison

The header's search button opens the search row, and `/` or Ctrl/Cmd+F opens and focuses it. The row stays open while a filter is active. It queries repository history beyond the graph's loaded commits, with 100 results per page. Enter a commit message or a resolvable SHA of at least seven characters. **Filters** adds literal author/email and path filters, inclusive dates, rename following for a single file, and named filters saved per repository. In **Filter to branch** view, a selected branch limits the history to that branch. Filtered results may omit commits between matches. **Return to Graph** clears the filters.

Right-click a file in Explorer, an editor title, or a commit's changed-file list and choose **File History**. Rename following retains the historical path at each commit. From a history row, open that file at its revision or choose **Restore File Contents**. The restore preview lets you choose the destination and compare its working contents with the historical version before confirming. Restore replaces the working file, including binary contents and Git file modes, and preserves the real index. A changed working file or index invalidates the preview. Historical previews use VS Code text documents; binary restoration does not require a text preview.

**Compare** accepts branch names, tags, or commits. Ref/commit menus also provide **Compare with…**, and selecting two rows offers **Compare Selected**. The result lists changed files and commits unique to each endpoint, with native VS Code diffs that leave the comparison dialog open. **Show changes introduced since the common ancestor** compares that ancestor with the right revision; the unique-commit lists still compare the two endpoints. Clicking a listed commit opens graph context beginning at that commit and its ancestors.

## Reflog and multiple commits

Open **Settings & Tools → Recover lost commits (reflog)** to inspect local branch and HEAD movements. **Show in Graph** opens the chosen commit's context, including commits no longer on a branch. **Create Recovery Branch** keeps that commit under a new branch without checking it out. Reflog availability follows Git's local retention and pruning.

Ctrl/Cmd-click selects individual commits; Shift-click selects a range. Select up to 100 commits for **Cherry-pick Selected** or **Revert Selected**. Review and adjust the execution order before confirming. Cherry-picks default to oldest first; reverts default to newest first. Merge commits require a common mainline parent choice. The native Git sequencer retains remaining commits if a conflict interrupts the batch; use the status strip's Continue, Abort, or Skip controls.

## Keyboard navigation and activity

Arrow keys move between commit rows; Home/End move to the first/last loaded row. Enter opens details, Space selects, and Shift+F10 opens actions. Ctrl/Cmd+F or `/` opens and focuses history search when no dialog is active. Repository switches preserve filters and scroll position.

Running operations show their repository, action, and elapsed time. **Hide** closes the progress dialog while Git continues. Push, pull, fetch, remote branch and tag deletion, and checkouts that fetch first also offer **Stop Git**, which ends the Git process, for example when a server stops responding, and frees the repository for other actions. Git never waits for a password typed in a terminal; use a credential helper or SSH agent. **Git Activity** retains the last 100 operations from this view, including results that arrive after switching repositories or opening another dialog. Errors have selectable output and **Copy Error Details**. This activity list lasts for the current graph view; it is separate from Git's reflog.

Closing a menu or dialog restores focus to the original control or commit row. On narrow windows the workspace sidebar moves above the graph and dialog fields stack vertically. Superseded history queries cancel their Git processes; hiding a mutation's progress dialog leaves that operation running.

## Validation and performance

`pnpm test:ext` includes the committed end-to-end UI checks and launches an isolated VS Code instance with a disposable workspace. Failed tests save diagnostic text under `test-results/`; successful UI checks capture screenshots there. CI is configured for Linux, Windows, and macOS and produces an installable VSIX artifact. `NGG_VSCODE_PATH` can select a local VS Code executable, and `NGG_HEADLESS=1` enables Linux headless runs.

`pnpm benchmark` measures backend history, focus, remote visibility, workspace scans, graph layout, and cancellation on a disposable large repository. `pnpm benchmark:ui` measures real VS Code graph interactions at several loaded-row counts and saves CPU profiles. See [Graph performance measurements](performance.md) for commands, fixture sizes, reports, and interpretation. CI records these diagnostic timings without enforcing machine-dependent speed thresholds.
